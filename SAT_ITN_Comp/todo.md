- [ ] Remove all references to SATURN and ITN and just call them shapefiles
- [ ] Add configuration file for all settings/options
- [ ] Output all settings used, as config file which can be loaded to do the link graphs
- [ ] Create documentation explaining how to use the tool
- [ ] Create build batch file for creating an executable using Pyinstaller
- [ ] Make post processing module more flexible and allow it to be accessed from the main script
- [ ] Create log file using the logging module
- [ ] Change requirements.txt into a conda environment YAML file
- [ ] Add GUI
- [ ] Rewrite README to contain information about setting up the Python environment and developing the tool and move how to run the tool to the user guide
- [ ] Add overlap buffer box to the ITN links found graphs
- [ ] Add check for empty geometries when reading the shapefiles
- [ ] Strip path in `filePath` before testing if it exists

# Search Algorithm
- [ ] When finding the start/end ITN links compare angles if multiple ITN links are found with **similar** distances not just the absolute closest
- [ ] When comparing angles when multiple links have been found if the angles are the same then pick the shortest link and just log a warning instead of raising an error
- [ ] Issues with cloverleaf type junctions where the shortest path sometimes jumps onto the motorway from a bridge because of how the ITN nodes are made up, options for fixing this:
  - [ ] Comparing angles between links as we're calculating shortest path and try a take the smoothest path i.e. no sharp $90^{\circ}$ angles; or
  - [ ] Trying to include the road name in the weighting for shortest path so it is more likely to stay on a single road.
- [ ] Dealing with circular ITN links
