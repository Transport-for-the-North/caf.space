Tool Usage
==========

.. attention::
    The tool usage docs pages are currently work-in-progress, if you have any suggestions
    for specific please consider raising an issue on
    `GitHub <https://github.com/transport-for-the-north/caf.space/issues>`__.

The tool has two main options for running a translation, either a purely spatial translation
(where overlapping zones are split by area), or a weighted translation where overlapping
zones are split by some other type of weighting data like population or employment data. For
most purposes a weighted translation will be more accurate, and it is up to the user to
decide the most appropriate weighting data to use.
