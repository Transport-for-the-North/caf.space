Welcome to caf.space's documentation!
=====================================

Common Analytical Framework (CAF) Space contain geo-processing functionality useful
for transport planners. Primarily it is a tool for generating standard weighting
translations in `.csv` format describing how to convert between different zoning systems.
The aim is to free tools up from directly having to do their own geo-processing, and    
instead have a single source of truth to get them from! Other tools include:

* `CAF.Toolkit <https://caftoolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_

* `CAF.Distribute <https://cafdistribute.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_

Tool info
---------
The tool has two main options for running a translation, either a purely spatial translation
(where overlapping zones are split by area), or a weighted translation where overlapping
zones are split by some other type of weighting data like population or employment data. for
most purposes a weighted translation will be more accurate, and it is up to the user to
decide the most appropriate weighting data to use. For both types of translation the tool
runs from a config file (a file called config.yml in the base folder). Parameters for this
config are described below.

Installation
------------
caf.space can be installed from pip with the command:

``pip install caf.space``

After that caf.space can be run using command line arguments. The easiest is to simply launch the UI

``python -m caf.space``

Additional arguments can also be provided for running a caf.space translation from a config file instead

``python -m caf.space --mode spatial --config path/to/config/file``

Here the mode can be set to either 'spatial', 'weighted', or 'GUI', although to launch the GUI no mode need be provided.
